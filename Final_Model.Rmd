```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load the packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sensitivity)
library(deSolve)
```

```{r}
SIR <- function(time, state, parms) {
  # SIR 
  # β is the transmission rate and β*S*I represents the number of susceptible individuals that become infected per   day
  # γ is the recovery rate and γ*I γ*I is the number of infected individuals that recover per day 
  # 1/γ is the infectious period i.e. the average duration of time an individual remains infected.
  
    with(as.list(c(state, parms)),{

        # Change in Susceptibles
        dS <- - beta * S * I  

        # Change in Infected
        dI <- beta * S * I - gamma * I 

        # Change in Recovered
        dR <- gamma * I 

    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR)))
    })
}

## Set parms
## Proportion in each compartment: Susceptible 0.999999, Infected 0.001, Recovered 0
# START DATE: April 16th where around 0.1% of the CA pop. was infected by COVID 
init <- c(S = .999, I = 0.001, R = 0.0)
parms <- c(beta = 1.4247, gamma = 0.14286)
## Time frame
time <- seq(1, 90, by = 1)

## Solve using ODE
out <- ode(y = init, times = time, func = SIR, parms = parms)
## change to data frame
out <- as.data.frame(out)
## Delete time variable
out$time <- NULL
## Show data
head(out, 10)

## Plot
matplot(x = time, y = out, type = "l",
        xlab = "Time", ylab = "Susceptible and Recovered", main = "SIR Model",
        lwd = 1, lty = 1, bty = "l", col = 2:4)
legend(40, 0.7, c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered"), pch = 1, col = 2:4, bty = "n")
```

Try to for loop the functions in nested for loops
```{r}

final_model<- function(time, i, parms){
  # make the parms list in the function
  b<- parms$b
  s<- parms$s
  k<- parms$k
  
  new_cases = b*s*new_cases - k*new_cases
  
  cases = new_cases + cases
  
  return(list(cases))
}

```

Run the ODE solver 
```{r}
parms = list(b = 2, s = 39510000, k = 100)

time = seq(from = 1, to = 365, by = 1)

i = 100 # initial infected population

result = ode(y = i, times = time, func = final_model, parms = parms)
head(result)

```

Make data data set that accounts for 
```{r}
covid<- as.data.frame(result)

colnames(covid)<- c("time", "infections")


# set up the parameter and coefficents that will work into the rest of the data
shelter_strength<- 0.2 # Strength of shelter in place measure
mean_temp<- rnorm(n = 365, mean = 65, sd = 5) # normal distribution of temperature
avg_mile_day = 974219178 # averge miles driven a day in CA noramlly
weather_coeff = 100000 # coefficient of weather on averge miles driven a day in CA
shelter_coeff = 100 # coefficient of shelter strength on miles driven a day in CA
mile_emissions = 0.411 # Emissions factor of 1 mile driven 

# add mean temperature into the covid data 
covid$temp<- mean_temp


# put in a for loop for the effect of shelter in place 
for (i in length(covid$time)){
  covid$infections_shelter = covid$infections * shelter_strength
}

# Put in a for loop for miles driven as dependant on infections_shelter and temperature
for (i in length(covid$time)){
  covid$miles_driven = avg_mile_day + weather_coeff * (covid$temp - mean(covid$temp)) - shelter_coeff * (1-shelter_strength)
}

# loop for ghg emissions
for (i in length(covid$time)){
  covid$ghg = covid$miles_driven * mile_emissions
}
