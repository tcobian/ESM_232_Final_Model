shelter_coeff = 100 # coefficient of shelter strength on miles driven a day in CA
mile_emissions = 0.411 # Emissions factor of 1 mile driven 
# add mean temperature into the covid data 
out$temp<- mean_temp
# Put in a for loop for miles driven as dependant on infections_shelter and temperature
for (i in length(out$S)){
  out$miles_driven = avg_mile_day + weather_coeff * (out$temp - mean(out$temp)) - shelter_coeff * (1-shelter_strength)

# loop for ghg emissions
